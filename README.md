## Disclaimer
**For users:** All pieces of software are presented here "as-is" and might be vulnerable for eventual attacks and exploits. Launch those programs at your own risk!
**For students:** If you're looking for a solution for your assignment, let's be fair: you better write stuff yourself. Even though you might freely use provided code, remember that your teachers might check the internet to find cases of plagiarism. So make sure to follow your school's rules on that topic.
**P.S.** If you use the code from any of these projects, I'm very curious about what kind of program you're writing... well, that's just a suggestion.
